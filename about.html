      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Kia Ora! I am Chloe Dilley and I run a podcast called Chloe Dilley Seeking Talents. My goal is to show people that everyone has talent in any way, shape or form. Anything can be a talent if you really put your dedication and your mind to it. I have been doing this podcast since I was only eight years old! I got invited by Plains Media to start my podcast and I joyfully accepted.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I play 3 instruments, learning a 4th now. I am involved with many youth and community spaces to empower young people in the best way possible and I love to run my podcast. So go have a listen to the podcast episodes and learn more about me here and on my social media! I hope you enjoyed reading about me. Have a great day.</p>
