      <h2>Idea behind Chloe Dilley Seeking Talents</h2>
      <p>When I was just eight years old, I got invited by Plains Media to start a podcast. They saw that I was the perfect person to start something like that. I was the youngest broadcaster for many years and now still one of the youngest. From this, I have gotten interviewed on Seven Sharp and won the title "Most Professional Podcaster" for Top of the Pods 2025. My goal is to empower people by giving them a chance to talk and for people to see them for how they are, share their stories, and tell us all about their incredible talents. My guests are all sorts of people with different talents, so make sure to go tune into all of the episodes!</p>
